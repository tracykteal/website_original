Electroporation

Items needed:
LB
Cuvette - .1 or .2cm gap
Plasmids
Competent cells
ependorphs 
test tubes


Thaw competent cells on ice
Mix 40microL cells and 2microL of the plasmid from a plasmid prep, and put the ependorph on ice
Put cuvette on ice (.2cm gap) for about 5 min
Put cells and plasmid mix into cuvette
Tap on table to get the cells to the bottom of the cuvette
Put cuvette into the machine until it clicks
Zap cells - (setting for .2cm gap = 2.5kV, 200ohms, 25microF)
Put in 1mL LB and pipet up and down to get cells into LB
Put LB and cells into test tube
Put in incubator at the temp the competent cells like and shake for 1 - 2.5 hours
Spread 100microL on plate with correct antibiotic resistance
Put plates in incubator at same temp as previously over night
Single colonies should grow

Also plate competent cells, non-electroporated, to make sure you're selecting
